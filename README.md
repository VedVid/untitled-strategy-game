#### What is this game?

At the current state, there is nothing to play. The game is in the very early stage of the development.


#### OK, so what will this game be like in the future?

I aim to create a small scale tactical game, in the veins of the Into The Breach. Just a handful of units on a small map, short missions, no micromanagement.


#### I don't see a license in the repository, is that an oversight?

While most of my work is released under open source licenses, that's not the case here. This project is only source-available.
